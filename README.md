# LITIengine LDJAM Project template
This project contains the source code of our game for the Ludum Dare Game Jam 44.
It was created in 72 hours and serves as an open-source **example project** for the LITIenine.

You can use this repository as a blueprint for LITIengine games and derive your own game structure from it.
